# Administrative Console Overview

The administrative (admin) console for Boundary is a graphical user interface for creating, reading,
updating, and deleting Boundary resources. The interface allows Boundary administrators the ability
to configure (or read configuration set by other clients such as our [Terraform provider](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-boundary) resources
or view and administer sessions.

If you're new to Boundary and are looking for a good place to start getting familiar with the Boundary
admin console, check out our [getting started](/docs/admin-console/getting-started) page in the side-bar.
