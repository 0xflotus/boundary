# Getting Started with the Admin Console

## Logging In

If you don't already have a deployment of Boundary, you can start one locally in dev mode:

```bash
$ boundary dev -password=foofoofoo -login-name=foo
```

Navigate to the login page in a browser, and enter your credentials

## View a Session

Start a TCP session to the default target

```bash
$ boundary connect -target-id ttcp_1234567890

Navigate to `projects` -> `sessions`

You can see multiple sessions, the last one is the latest one. In this view we can see two others
